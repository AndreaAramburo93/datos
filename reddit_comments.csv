moleyhtfc,2020-10-01 08:10:56,Polygon hate it. Fantastic news.,66,g7a5smf
Mr_Mimiseku,2020-10-01 10:10:32,"I hate to ""reviewer"" shame, but they state:

""Unfortunately, no matter how good they look, each of the game’s dozens of levels feels more or less the same to play, just with different combinations of floating platforms, enemies, and endless pits for Crash to jump over.""

Isn't that literally every platformer.",60,g7ajvnv

Jykaes,2020-10-01 10:52:27,"I fucking loved Doom Eternal. After initial teething pains adapting to the way it wants you to play, it ended up being my all time favourite FPS. It was extremely difficult at first on Ultra Violence because I kept trying to play it like a ""normal"" FPS but once you understand how it wants you to manage your fights, it ends up being amazing.",7,g7app9h
brobronn17,2020-10-01 16:14:07,Can you elaborate on how it's a different FPS experience? Considering buying it.,1,g7byki9
Anunnak1,2020-10-01 17:57:03,"Doom has always wanted to keep you going, encouraging you to always be on the move killing something. Eternal keeps that going by adding different mechanics like the chainsawing lower teir enemies to get ammo, or using a flame thrower on them to get armor, using the meat hook to grapple to a enemy and fly into their face, the added story wasn't really needed but its still has amazing gameplay. If you have xbox game pass, it was just adder to that service.",2,g7ca0u6
Jykaes,2020-10-01 21:29:36,"What /u/Annukak1 said, I read a review or a dev statement once that basically said every big fight is like a game of chess and it's sort of true in a general sense. I kept dying because I kept rushing into every fight and trying to mow down enemies, the game is deliberately made so that is essentially impossible. You are always low on health, armour and ammo and the game expects you to be managing them by using the specific tools you have at your disposal while you're still being attacked by loads of demons. Chainsaw for ammo, flame belch for armour, glory kill for health. But then on top of that every high tier enemy has specific strengths and weaknesses you need to adapt to, and the game will use some of them to its advantage later on to force you to focus on those enemies while avoiding others.

There is a shitload more going on that it might seem from watching gameplay. There is genuine strategy and some areas like slayer gates throw so much at you that it overwhelms you and you're extremely close to death and you can't stop to think or figure out what to do, you just have to keep moving to get some respite. I'm not gonna lie, early on it can feel a little restrictive. But it starts to ""click"" a few levels in and it becomes an awesome experience, genuinely.",2,g7cxm6v
Catalyst138,2020-10-01 11:49:20,This is how we get stuff like Big the Cat in Sonic Adventure. Adding variety for the sake of variety is not a good thing. And Crash 4 has enough variety as it is with the different characters.,10,g7axjgq
Sarmathal,2020-10-01 14:42:16,Exactly. Crash 3 tried to hard to differentiate itself with all the vehicle levels which (mostly) suck.,3,g7blmak

_-Tectal,2020-10-02 18:12:59,What's wrong with Polygon not absolutely loving the game?,1,g7glikz
Jykaes,2020-10-01 10:49:26,"I got their review in my Google feed (It's why I came to this thread actually) and I didn't know Polygon hate was a thing so I read it starting off worried, but as I got further into it I kept disagreeing with statements the author made thinking ""That sounds like a good classic platformer should be"" and then I got to this:

&gt;*Crash 3*, for all its fun moments and great design, is a fundamentally unfriendly game. It is still good, in part because it was working within the limited powers of the PlayStation 1. Where *Crash 4* goes wrong is in mistaking that old-game unfriendliness for an important feature.

I literally want this game to be a modernised sequel to Warped. If the Polygon's chief complaint is that it's too much like Warped, that sounds perfect to me. I can't wait.",12,g7apaj3
ResidentSleeperCell,2020-10-01 11:11:53,"The reason for the lower score is because the reviewer doesn't like it, which can be disagreed with but it's also a good review in the sense that the author's criticisms have informed you in a way that you can tell the game will be enjoyable.",8,g7asea5
iforgot87872,2020-10-05 22:53:42,"Well really, it's harder than warped, which I love. Warped was too easy. When this reviewer says Warped is such a hard game, he's so wrong. It's an easy game. The first 2 games are harder, the first is the hardest (Well it was the hardest haha). 4 is great if you liked the challenge of the first 2 and the nice  cartoony worlds of warped I would say.",1,g7v4fu5

anoleo201194,2020-10-01 08:47:55,"I'd give TLOU around the same score honestly, story was great but the gameplay was pretty bad. Uncharted is my 2nd favourite series so obviously I love the gameplay there, and the first few hours of TLOU 2 I played made it so much better just for the gameplay enhancements.",3,g7a9enn
Sandroes,2020-10-01 09:25:11,"I get it if some might not like the gameplay but it doesn’t make it bad, just different.
Especially if you like Uncharted, going to TLOU is just so much different having a slower pace in every side of the gameplay, but giving it the same score as a mediocre game is just crazy.",2,g7adqzw
DayfacePhantasm,2020-10-01 19:29:08,7.5 is a good score.,3,g7ck2hj
Fries-Ericsson,2020-10-01 10:06:35,At the end of the day each review is only a subjective view of any game I suppose,2,g7ajbu2

iamdoogle,2020-10-01 09:58:54,"I first came onto this sub in mid June 2016 after the remake news to (unsurprisingly) find a completely dead sub with a few posts here and there about the recently announced remakes. I cannot believe over four years later we’re a day away from the long awaited sequel that’s a critical (and likely commercial) success. Not only that, but the sub is busy with fans both old and new. To see how far he’s come since being dead in 2015 I’m honestly just so ecstatic about it, to think kid me is finally getting the sequel I always dreamed of. And at 23 years old it’s finally real!",34,g7ai9u9
anoleo201194,2020-10-01 10:17:24,"As a 25 year old I understand how you feel. The original trilogy on the PS1 were some of my favourite games and I have so many good memories playing with my siblings and finding out the secret stages. Seeing this sub be reinvigorated brings such a big smile on my face, even if I won't get to play the game for a little while longer.",12,g7aktuu
iamdoogle,2020-10-01 10:58:13,It’s a wonderful thing. It seems like there’s plenty of secrets to discover in the new one too. Hope you don’t have to wait too long to play it!,2,g7aqibo

iamdoogle,2020-10-01 12:24:10,I mean a lot of people probably didn’t play it exactly when it came out. I didn’t play them until the early 00s because we didn’t have a ton of money and I was born in 97,5,g7b27a2

anoleo201194,2020-10-01 12:51:48,Same here basically. I got my PS1 in 2000 roughly so I played Crash when I was around 8-9 a couple years later.,3,g7b60rn

[deleted],2020-10-06 06:50:46,"I’m 23 as well, played all the Crash games. And I can honestly tell you Crash 4 is fucking amazing. The satisfaction from unlocking skins, visual effects, music, the 3D perspective variety in levels, all the content...

People who criticise it for being too ‘Crash’ or too ‘90s’ - leave them. They don’t get it and never will.

I’m sure you already have, but if not, buy it. That’s not a request, that’s a demand :D",1,g7vwxjt

armoredcore48,2020-10-03 12:40:26,"Games is hard, like holy fuck balls is hard. After first island the game just ups the difficulty to the 11. Million of boxes to find and if you miss one then gg. 

  
Unlocking skins is super annoying, they should have let you get skins depending the numbers of gems you have and not gate them under 6 gems to unlock skin on current level. Because some levels are insanely over stacked with gimmicks just to be there. And if you die more than 3 times, then no gem and no skin. 

Plus there is a level where you need to backtrack which is again, be it crash 2 or 3 then it\`s fine. But not here. I dont know why the Fuck they overturned this game so much it\`s not even fun. 

It makes you frustrating and if you manage to finish the level you dont feel relief you feel - finally this shit has ended. Only to be greeted with Oh shit I need to re do as I missed one box.",3,g7j65j2
